# As the Sun Rises: The Economic Journey of Bangladesh

As the sun rises over the sprawling metropolis of Dhaka, the bustling streets come alive with the sound of honking horns and the chatter of merchants setting up shop. Despite the chaos, one thing is clear: the Royal Bengal Tiger—which symbolizes the country’s bravery and intelligence—is on the rise.

## Bangladesh's Economic Growth

Bangladesh, a country with a history of positive GDP growth, has become the world's second-largest producer of textiles. Since its foundation in 1971, Bangladesh has emerged as a beacon of economic growth.

## Covid-19 in Bangladesh

Facing the challenges of COVID-19, Bangladesh implemented rigorous measures, including lockdowns and mandatory mask-wearing, successfully containing the virus's spread.

### Bangladeshi Utopia in 2020

As of June 2021, Bangladesh’s response to COVID-19 was multifaceted, including fiscal responses, monetary policies, and maintaining a stable exchange rate.

#### Fiscal Response

The government's fiscal measures included stimulus packages and financial assistance programs to support the hardest-hit sectors and populations.

#### Monetary Policies

The Bangladesh Bank implemented several policies to ensure liquidity, stimulate economic activity, and support various sectors.

#### Exchange Rates

The Taka remained relatively stable, demonstrating the success of Bangladesh's economic policies.

## Dystopic Reality in 2022

However, 2022 presented new challenges, with rising political instability, supply chain issues, and currency valuation problems leading to economic difficulties.

### Overreliance on the Textile Industry
